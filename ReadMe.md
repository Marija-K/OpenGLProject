# Gravity Platformer

A platformer in which you can reverse gravity. You cannot reverse gravity while in mid-air. Falling off will reset you to the start or the furthest reached checkpoint marked by the line of greenblocks. You can walk diagonally between blocks. There are 5 sections that get harder the further you go. Once you reach the end there is a congratulations message.
